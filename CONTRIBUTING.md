# Contributing to YUG-AI ChatApp

We love your input! We want to make contributing to YUG-AI ChatApp as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the MIT License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/yugai-chatapp/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/yugai-chatapp/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write Bug Reports with Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for both client and server
3. Set up environment variables
4. Run the development servers
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes
7. Submit a pull request

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow React best practices
- Use ES6+ features when appropriate

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test manually in both development and production builds
- Test on different screen sizes and devices

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Update API documentation for backend changes

1. Check if the feature has already been requested
2. Open a new issue with the "feature request" label
3. Provide a clear description of the feature
4. Explain why this feature would be useful
5. Consider submitting a pull request!
